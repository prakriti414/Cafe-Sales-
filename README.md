Cafe Sales Data Analysis- SQL + Tableau
In this project, I worked with a dirty sales dataset from a cafe containing 10,000 transactions. The dataset included common real-world issues such as missing values, inconsistent categories, wrong data types, and errors in numeric fields.

The goal was to:
	1.	Clean the dataset to make it reliable for analysis.
	2.	Perform SQL-based business analysis.
	3.	Create visualizations in Tableau for insights.
	4.	Recommend business strategies based on findings.
